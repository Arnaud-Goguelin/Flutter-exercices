# multiple_counters

A new Flutter exercice from:
https://pro.codewithandrea.com/get-started-flutter/intro/06-state-management 
## Getting Started

To get some practice with Flutterâ€™s built-in tools for state management, I prepared the following challenge.

Extend the default Flutter counter app to work with multiple counters so that it looks like this:
Daily challenge #1: try to implement a multiple conters app

The resulting app should have:

    a floating action button that you can use to add a new counter
    a ListView that shows all the counters
    each item in the ListView should show the counter value and have buttons to increment/decrement the counter value

For this challenge, you can store all the counter values as local application state (no need to persist them to local storage).
